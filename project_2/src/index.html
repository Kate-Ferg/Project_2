          Ayo is Cedarville University's artistic dance company!
        </p>
        <p>
          We involve dancers of all styles, skills, and backgrounds in movement,
          collaboration and art. "Ayo" ("EYE-OH") is a Yoruba word meaning
          "joy!" Dance is a celebration! Our goal is to glorify God through
          dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our verse is Jeremiah 31:13 which says, "Then young women will dance
          and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning
          into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow."

              Ballet is just one of the many dance styles we showcase in our
              organization. Whether you have a perfect pirouette or don't know

            <p>
              Swing dances are just as fun for the audience as they are for the
              dancers. If you're looking for a thrill and you're up for the
              challenge, this is the perfect partner dance to audition for.

            <h3>Hip-Hop</h3>

              alt="A male hip-hop dancer doing a one-handed hand stand"
            />
            <p>
              Hip-hop dance is a fusion dance genre that incorporates elements
              of popping, locking, breaking, jazz, ballet, tap dancing and other
              styles. This style will let you tap into your edgey side!

            <h3>Tap</h3>

              alt="Female tap dancer standing on heels on a bridge"
            />
            <p>
              Our tap dances really get the crowd into the rhythm! This style
              can get a bit technical with all the toe-tapping, but it's
              definitely worth the practice and it's always a hit. We offer
              dnaces for both seasonaed tappers and novices.

        <h2>Organization Opportunitiesâ€¦</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of every semester Ayo puts on a showcase for our dancers
          and choreographers to show off what they've put together. This event
          welcomes all friends and family to join and watch as each dance is
          performed by our members! If you're on the fence about joining, just
          attend one of our showcases to get a good idea of what it means to be
          a part of the organization. Attending our showcases is a great way to
          support our dancers and experience the performing arts. With the
          variety of talent in all the different dance styles, we promise you
          won't be disappointed!
        </p>
        <h3 class="list-title">Ways to be involved:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sign up for dances and participate as a dancer. You can sign up
              for as many or as little number of dances as you want. Each dance
              will have one hour-long practice a week, and attendance to these
              classes are mandatory.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you have a dance background and are passionate about
              choreographing, try teaching one of your own dances. You will get
              to write and teach a dance to a class. The song and costumes that
              go with it are up to you as well!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Don't want to teach a class, but also want to choreograph with
              friends? We have duet and small group auditions for that! Find a
              friend or two and get a little more technical with your moves to
              show off your skill.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If it's been your dream to solo, start planning now! Audition for
              a solo of your chosen dance style and have the stage all to
              yourself as we cheer you on! This is a great was to showcase your
              individual talent, skill, and style.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some other dance styles that we've had through the years include
          lyrical, contemporary, jazz, salsa, pointe, irish step, 70s, 80s, 90s
          throwback, and more. If you have experience in any other style of
          dance and want to bring it to Ayo, we would love for you to
          choreograph and share with us. We're always eager to have fun learning
          something new.
